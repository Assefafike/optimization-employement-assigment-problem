The relocation expense budget for all three moves is $200000. The costs (in thousands of dollars) of relocating
each individual to each location are also given in the code:
Formulate and solve an integer programming model allowing you to decide which individual should be assigned
to which office.

by using optimization method using linear programming what i got is 
Jones       -->   Chicago
Goldblum    -->   Boston
Schuldinger -->   Atlanta
